== Compile ==

Can be compiled with the gcc-compiler with the following command:

    gcc -O3 CHP-comp.c


== Running the program ==

The program takes one argument, namely the path to the test
file. I.e.:

    ./CHP.exe testfiles/test03.uwg

It can also be run by just executing the program, after which it will
prompt you to enter the path to a test file.

Output of the program will be the value of B, newline and then a
space-seperated list of edges in the MFMST.
